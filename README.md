# Succubus Dungeon #

Succubus Dungeon is a mod for vanilla and Masterwork Dwarf Fortress featuring a new evil civ. It is developed one feature at a time and new features is added regularly.

# Features #
* A new race.
* Fast and fire immune citizens.
* The reintroduction of classic lore into Dwarf Fortress such as 40d demons.
* Generating slade blocks to build an authentic demonic spire.
* Generate fuel for your forges out of thin air.

# Installation #
* Install DF 42.03+, using the lazy newb pack is recommended.
* Extract the archive in your DF folder, preserving the folder structure.
* Generate a new world and select a succubus civ to play.

# IMPORTANT: Selecting your race at the embark screen #
* Press tab before embarking until seeing a list of civilization names.
* Press + and - to chose a civ that uses the 'cabinet' tile to display its colonies on the map.
* Pressing tab again until seeing the list of neighbors will confirm your choice, your selected race is the first one.

# Modified vanilla files #
The following changes were done on the original DF files. Please keep them in mind if you combine this mod with others.
* entity_default.txt: Added siege triggers to dwarves, made humans, elves and kobold attack faster.

# Magma #
Magma is a major resource for this race. Succubi are immune to heat and many of their workshops are powered by molten rock.

Buildings marked with a star '*' must be powered by magma. There is currently no way to easily generate magma but this will be added in the near future.

Succubi are immune to any form of heat and cold. Unfortunatly the game prevent your citizens from walking in magma. If a succubus is stuck because a puddle of magma is in her way, you can wait for it to evaporate or dig around. Succubi inside magma will evacuate without burning clothing or weapons but hauled items will be likely destroyed.

Also, remember that magma is a liquid and someone can drown in it if they cannot swim.

# Getting slade and construction materials #
Slade can be generated at no cost in an underworld drill to help you build your spires. However, its extreme weight implies that slade projects will take more time and builders to complete. A smart usage of stockpiles and wheelbarrows is strongly recommended.

To get slade blocks, build the underworld drill from the furnaces menu after discovering magma. Like magma forges, it must have one of its tiles overlapping a pit with at least 4 levels of magma. A miner can then conjure slade blocks (for construction) or boulders (for craft or masonry jobs).

If you wish to make a glass tower instead, glass blocks can easily be produced using the Floating Glass Furnace, built using a tin bar. This workshop is ten times more efficient than a regular glass furnace but must also cover an access to magma like the Underworld Drill.

# Adventuring as a succubi #
Civilizations living in dark fortresses are not as well developed than dwarven or human ones. As a result, a succubus starts at an empty pit without the ability to fast travel. It is recommended that you start playing as a succubus assimilated into another civilization, preferably human (# tiles on the world map) or dwarven (omega tiles on the world map).

If you start in a pit, you can open the regional map (shift + Q) to spot the nearest dark fortress, then travel by foot in this direction to find people to talk to.

Wandering around, you may also find dungeons with equipment and towers with population on its roof. If you are unable to reach the roof, try pressing alt+direction to open the hatch above your head.

# Known issues #
* Embarking as dwarves? See "Selecting your race at the embark screen" above.
* Upon reaching your site's edge, traders will "kidnap" their own pets, this has no consequenses to your fort.
* Changing graphics in the Lazy Newb Pack deletes the mod, you'll have to reinstall it afterwards.
