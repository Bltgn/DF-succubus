# Succubus Dungeon #

Succubus Dungeon is a mod for vanilla and Masterwork Dwarf Fortress featuring a new evil civ. It is developed one feature at a time and new features is added regularly.

## Features ##
* A new race.
* Fast and fire immune citizens.
* The reintroduction of classic lore into Dwarf Fortress such as 40d demons.
* Generate magma anywhere, make magma forge on the surface, traps, waterfalls...
* Generating slade blocks to build an authentic demonic spire.
* Generate fuel for your forges out of thin air.
* Capture invaders and turn them into half demons.
* Summon powerful creatures to your side.

## Installation ##
* Install Dwarf Fortress 42.06+, using the lazy newb pack is recommended.
* Install dfhack for the appropriate DF version is needed.
* Extract the archive in your DF folder, preserving the folder structure.
* Generate a new world and select a succubus civ to play.

## IMPORTANT: Selecting your race at the embark screen ##
* Press tab before embarking until seeing a list of civilization names.
* Press + and - to chose a civ that uses the cabinet tile (Ï€) to display its colonies on the map.
* Pressing tab again until seeing the list of neighbors will confirm your choice, your selected race is the first one.

## Modified vanilla files ##
The following changes were done on the original DF files. Please keep them in mind if you combine this mod with others.

* entity_default.txt: Added siege triggers to dwarves, made humans, elves and kobold attack faster, dwarves are no longer playable at embark.
* creature_subterranean.txt: Added pet value to fire imps.

## Magma ##
Magma is a major resource for this race. Succubi are immune to heat and many of their workshops are powered by molten rock.

Buildings marked with a star '*' in its name must be powered by magma. You can easily provide magma to your dungeon by building a magma well. With this workshop, a pump operator can fill all nearby channels with enough magma to power buildings.

Unfortunatly the game does not allow your citizens to walk in magma. If a succubus is stuck because a puddle is in her way, you can wait for it to evaporate or dig around. Succubi inside magma will still evacuate without burning clothing or weapons but hauled items will be likely destroyed.

As an option, if your succubi are running out of drink and cannot find water, you can bring magma next to a still and turn it into a drink. You will need rock pots for this.

Also, remember that magma is a liquid and someone can drown in it if they cannot swim.

# Getting slade and construction materials #
Slade can be generated at no cost in an underworld drill to help you build your spires. However, its extreme weight implies that slade projects will take more time and builders to complete. A smart usage of stockpiles and wheelbarrows is strongly recommended.

To get slade blocks, build the underworld drill from the furnaces menu after discovering magma. Like magma forges, it must have one of its tiles overlapping a pit with at least 4 levels of magma. A miner can then conjure slade blocks (for construction) or boulders (for craft or masonry jobs).

If you wish to make a glass tower instead, glass blocks can easily be produced using the Floating Glass Furnace, built using a tin bar. This workshop is ten times more efficient than a regular glass furnace.

## New materials ##

Because the succubi wish to reshape the world in their image, you will obtain of new materials to build with:

* Afelsteel: This corrupted steel is extremely dense and possess a sharper edge, making it great for weaponsmithing.
* Octobronze: An unaturally light bronze best suited to provide your succubi with a light and solid protection.

## Summoning ##
You can spawn pets in your fort by building a summoning portal over a magma pit. Evil pets are useful for various tasks or can be butchered for food.

Please note that spawned pets are more aggressive than natural ones and are prone to attack if they lack personal space. Isolating them or giving them large pasture zones will reduce the risks.

A description of each pets abilities will be displayed while selecting the jobs from the summoning portal itself.

## Corruption ##
An unique feature from the succubi is their ability to twist the bodies and souls of their guests at their image. Their victims, willingly or not, are turned into hybrids with various abilities depending of their former race.

This is done at the den of iniquity. Running the 'Corrupt prisoners' job will transform nearby sentients and have them join your civilization. This include caged invaders if their cages are visible and close enough. Merchants and their guards will also join, but their pack animal will flee or go insane.

Corrupting prisoners is also compatible with the Fortress Defense mod.

## Adventuring as a succubus ##
Civilizations living in dark fortresses are not as well developed than dwarven or human ones. As a result, a succubus starts at an empty pit without the ability to fast travel. It is recommended that you start playing as a succubus assimilated into another civilization, preferably human (# tiles on the world map) or dwarven (omega tiles on the world map).

If you start in a pit, you can open the regional map (shift + Q) to spot the nearest dark fortress, then travel by foot in this direction to find people to talk to.

Wandering around, you may also find dungeons with equipment and towers with population on its roof. If you are unable to reach the roof, try pressing alt+direction to open the hatch above your head.

## Known issues ##
* Embarking as dwarves? See "Selecting your race at the embark screen" above.
* Upon reaching your site's edge, traders will "kidnap" their own pets, this has no consequenses to your fort.
* Changing graphics in the Lazy Newb Pack deletes the mod, you'll have to reinstall it afterwards.
* The game treat succubi blood as magma hot. Wounded succubi are likely to cause wildfires.
* This has been made for an alpha version of dfhack, expect bugs. Save a lot and make backups.
