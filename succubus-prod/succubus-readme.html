<h2 id="playing-as-succubi">Playing as Succubi</h2>
<h3 id="nobles-and-positions">Nobles and Positions</h3>
<p>Here are the administratives positions and their dwarven equivalents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matron and Matriarch -&gt; Expedition Leader and Mayor</li>
<li>Keeper of Secrets -&gt; Both Book Keeper and Manager, enables accounting and the job manager</li>

</ul>
<p>The civiliation nobles are as usual with a monarch, a general and priestess plus local regents who can designate champions.</p>
<h3 id="magma">Magma</h3>
<p>Magma is a major resource for this race. Succubi are immune to heat and many of their workshops are powered by molten rock. Buildings marked with a star in its name must be powered by magma. You can easily provide magma to your dungeon by building a magma well. With this workshop, a pump operator create a magma “aquifer”. To do so, channel a canal in one direction from the well and run the appropriate reaction. The same magma well can also stop all those flows anytime you wish.</p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<pre><code>  Z       Z-1
+++++    +++++ 
+WWW+    +++++
+WWW.    ++++~ -&gt; After channeling the east side, the well created a flow in this direction.
+WWW+    +++++
+++++    +++++
</code></pre>
<p>The game being designed for creatures that die in magma, movement and pathing may behave strangely. Succubi may walk into magma and their clothing will not be affected, but hauled items or wagons will burn. If you construct a magma moat, it is best to fill at 6 or 7 levels deep or else caravans will got for a dip.</p>
<h3 id="construction-materials">Construction materials</h3>
<p>Slade can be generated at no cost in an underworld drill to help you build your spires. However, its extreme weight implies that slade projects will take more time and builders to complete. A smart usage of stockpiles and wheelbarrows is recommended.</p>
<p>If you wish to make a glass tower instead, glass blocks can easily be produced using the Floating Glass Furnace, built using a tin bar. This workshop is more efficient than a regular glass furnace.</p>
<h3 id="summoning">Summoning</h3>
<p>You can spawn pets in your fort by building a summoning portal over a magma pit. Evil pets are useful for various tasks or can be butchered for food. A description of each pets abilities will be displayed while selecting the jobs from the summoning portal itself. Some creatures summoned from the portal are also intelligent and can perform civilian tasks or join the military.</p>
<h3 id="corruption">Corruption</h3>
<p>An unique feature from the succubi is their ability to twist the bodies and souls of their guests at their image. Their victims are turned into hybrids with various abilities depending of their former race. This is done at the den of iniquity. Running the ‘Corrupt foreigners’ job will transform nearby sentients and have them join your civilization. This include caged invaders if their cages are visible and close enough. Merchants and their guards can also join your forces in the process, but their pack animals will flee or go insane.</p>
<p>Results may vary if you mix this mod with others. Currently only Fortress Defense and Masterwork Dwarf Fortress are supported.</p>
<h3 id="giving-powers-to-your-succubi">Giving powers to your succubi</h3>
<p>The Altar of Sin provides give additional interactions to your succubi. Those are seperated in major and minor categories with major providing several buffs and interactions and minor providing single spells.</p>
<p>Each succubus can only acquire one minor and one major spell so you will have to discover the best combos and spread your upgrades among the key citizens of your fort.</p>
<p>To select the target of an upgrade, you must use the workshop profile (Shift + P after selecting a Keeper of Secrets) and restrict the usage to only one worker. If the target is in the military, you will need to put the squad off duty until the target has acquired the power.</p>
<h4 id="major-powers">Major powers</h4>
<p>Major powers act as secrets like necromancy does in vanilla and, in rare cases, will be researched by historical figures. While the succubi are already immortal, member from other races will be granted immortality upon acquiring one of those.</p>

<li>Alluring song: Make the enemy slow and crazy for a short time, causing them to hit each other. The target may also flee in terror afterwards.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="adventuring-as-a-succubus">Adventuring as a succubus</h2>
<p>Civilizations living in dark fortresses are not as well developed than dwarven or human ones for adventure. As a result, a succubus begin their journey in an empty pit without the ability to fast travel. It is recommended that you start playing as a succubus assimilated into another civilization, preferably human (# tiles on the world map) or dwarven (Ω tiles on the world map).</p>
<p>If you start in a pit, you can open the regional map (shift + Q) to spot the nearest dark fortress then travel by foot in this direction to find people to talk to. Wandering around, you may also find dungeons with equipment and towers with population on its roof. To reach the roof of a tower, press alt+direction to open the hatch above your head.</p>
<p>You can also play as a Frog Demon. Try biting people!</p>
<h2 id="known-issues">Known issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Embarking as dwarves? See “Selecting your race at the embark screen” above.</li>
<li>Changing graphics in the Lazy Newb Pack deletes the mod. You’ll have to reinstall it afterwards.</li>
<li>Upon reaching your site’s edge, traders will “kidnap” their own pets, this has no consequenses to your fort.</li>
<li>If a frog demon refuses to work or join the military, wait 3 days of game time and try again.</li>
<li>The summoning portal may cause some flickering or turn the screen black, press tab a few times to recover.</li>
