who I sent back to the abyss where [PRO_POS] kind belong
whose depraved ways has led [PRO_OBJ] to [PRO_POS] doom
who tried to make me [PRO_POS] pet with no success
who was not my style
now a beautiful corpse
who tried to flight but [PRO_POS] wings could not hold [PRO_OBJ]
no monster from the darkness could have saved [PRO_OBJ]
I bet it felt good for [PRO_OBJ]
if you know what I mean
quite a disappointing demon
