        <p align="center">The
succubi are human sized creatures will demonic properties. They have
good strength and great agility but their endurance is lacking. As a
result they hit quickly in battle, landing crippling blows before their
enemies have time to react. As a result there is a huge difference
between a badly trained and a legendary fighter. Their poor focus on
the other hand make them average archers at best.</p><p align="center">They
do not bite in battle, instead using life draining kisses and licks.
Those attacks can inject venom that reduces speed or even cause
paralysis. Another combat asset are their hooves giving extra damage to
their kicks.</p><p align="center">As a civilian, the succubi are lazy
and will take long breaks, but their good intelligence will help them
produce fine goods for you. Their short temper will make mood a
priority, even if tantrum spirals are less likely to happen.</p><p align="center">The succubi are very well suited in sorcery and animal traning, those two skills are often used in their dungeon.</p><p align="center">It is easier to play this civilization in general. They are stronger, have less children to take care off and several</p>

        <h1 align="center"><a name="bb" id="bb">Nobles</a></h1>
        <ul><li>Queen, baron, count, duke : the usual nobles. They contribute little besides issuing mandates... for now.</li><li>Leader / Mistress : the selected leader of your dungeon, they will conduct meetings with unhappy workers and diplomats.</li><li>Lady
of Pain : the leader of your military, you might need her quickly but
you will be hard pressed to meet her standards. Treat her well and she
will be happy to terminate your enemies in the most painful ways
possible.</li><li>Battle guide : will lead your military squads under
the command of the lady of pain. They will all ask for an assigned tomb
so their names and feats are remembered.</li><li>Enforcer / Guardian :
the lawgiver of your dungeon. She will manage punishement as usual.
When 50 succubi have settled inside the walls, the guardian can build a
squad to keep the tiny order a dungeon full of demon can support.</li><li>Whipper : handles capital punishement. When she is not whipping criminals, she will meet unhappy workers to help her mistress.</li><li>Keeper
of secrets : your manager and book keeper in the same succubus. This
role is usually given to the most shy succubus who has no issue
dissapearing for months in her office.</li><li>Attorney : the assigned
broker and merchant. In truth the one who can afford speaking to orcs,
goblins or giants. She will measure your wealth and get rid of your
unwanted items.</li></ul>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="cc" id="cc">Pets</a></h1>
        <p align="center">You
will&nbsp;have a choice of creatures at the embark screen. That
includes the underground creatures plus a few select demonic entities :</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nahash</span> : a vermin hunting snake. Not very strong on its own.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rat thing</span> : a vermin hunting rat. They can teleport towards their enemies for a surprise attack.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Soul wisp </span>: Those little balls of light will boost your civilians a bit. When killed they also release a gass that put everyone to sleep.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Orthus</span> : a two headed aggressive dog. They can be trained for hunting or war.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cauchemar</span> : a strong horse that never tire. The females can be milked. They also require a small grazing space.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tentacle monster </span>:
a good fighter. Those can be milked for hteir slime that can act as a
substitute for oil. They will also secrete slime, leaving trails of
contaminants that will stun intruders walking in.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lesser basilisks</span> : reptiles that breath poisonous vapors. Their horn can be sheared to prduce basiliskine, a lightweight steel grade metal.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shothoth spawn</span> : a large monster that will turn itself invisible to its enemies and can hit with a deadly necrosis slime.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fire imp</span> : &nbsp;a small humanoid that can hurl fireballs at its enemies.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Horrible Fell Spirit</span> : Unavailable at the embark screen. An HFS can be a lot of thing, most of those are very deadly.</li></ul><p align="center">All
those creatures can be summoned in your fort by building a summoning
circle and seeking the items required for their arrival. None of those
creatures affect each other or the succubi with their syndromes. They
can also eat evil plants without going mad.</p><p align="center">In addition to those pets, scouts may go and tame other pets their civilizations has encountered during world gen.<br /></p>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="cc2" id="cc2">Items</a></h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">You
have access to most of the standard items of the game. Both surface and
undeground crops will also be available for trading. Here is the
weapons and protection you can produce for your military :</p><p style="text-align: left;">Armors :</p><ul><li>Standard gauntlets, boots and helmet.</li><li>Corsets for the body. Those does not protect well but can be worn at the same time as a leather armor or a stolen breastplate.</li><li>You can make chain mails with metal or bodysuits with leather to protect the&nbsp;body against cuts.</li><li>Round shields. Setting the uniform on shield/buckler will let the succubi pick better shields from fallen enemies.</li></ul><p style="text-align: left;">Weapons :&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Lasher weapons : Whips (blunt) and bladed whips (edged).</li><li>Piercing : Pitchforks, can be upgraded at the soul forge for more strenght and ranged abilities.</li><li>Blades : Large daggers, duel swords, long swords and claymore.</li><li>Axes : Double edged axes and great axes.</li><li>Ranged : Recurve bows for general support, stygian pitchfork can fire special shards that can explode or causes syndromes.</li></ul>Traps :<br /><ul><li>Sawblades, several workshop require those.</li><li>Axe blades, spiked balls, razor wires and serrated spikes.</li><li>Pump mechanisms</li></ul>Ammo : <br /><ul><li>Arrows</li><li>Spell shard : Does less damage than ammo but special ones can be made at the soul forge.</li><ul><li>Force shard : causes a cave in effect, knocking creatures out.</li><li>Blight shard : creates severe necrosis clouds</li><li>Pain shard : inflict pain to the affect creatures</li><li>Make sure you properly set up the ammo in your military screen. Do not let your warriors train with special shard!</li></ul></ul>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="mini" id="dd3">Materials</a></h1>
        <p align="center">The
succubi cannot make steel or mithril, be it by a lack of focus or
technology. They are unable to clean rusty steel either. You can still
get these metals by melting equipment picked from (dead) dwarves and
elves. In that case, those will be your best metals to make weapons
with.</p><p align="center">They have however access to two lightweight
metals : Stygian bronze and basiliskine. Those materials are well
suited to make armor and are still effective for blades but terrible
for blunt weapons. Stygian bronze is made from regular bronze and flux
stone, basiliskine must be sheared from lesser basilisks and treated at
a smelter. Be careful that those metals, having high value, will make
sieges harder once produced.</p><p align="center">If you have access to
sand and magma, you can build a floating glass furnace and make glass
blocks and windows in great quantities. Making raw glass and pouring it
at the furnace will allow you to make glass constructions faster.</p><p align="center">Something
to note is that mining warpstone is much safer. In fact, a miner
breathing unstable warpstone will e greatly boosted for a few seconds.<br /></p>
<hr />
      <h1 align="center"><a name="dd" id="dd">Special Tactics</a></h1>
      <p align="center">This
civilization does not move away from the core Dwarf Fortress gameplay
and usual tactics can be used here. However you will be pressured into
pushing your defenses furthers and new workshops will help you to
prepare your fort.</p><p align="center"></p></td>
